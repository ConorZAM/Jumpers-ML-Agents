# Jumpers-ML-Agents

This is a project exploring jumping motions using proximal policy optimisation.

The ML-Agents package is required and will have to be imported into the unity project for everything to work, I was unable to upload the whole project as GitHub didn't like the file size. (Any suggestions for this would be great).

Everything you need to know about ML-Agents, including downloads, can be found here: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents
